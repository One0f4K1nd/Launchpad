C++/Qt SWGEmu launchpad -- Modified Launcher for ModTheGalaxy development environment

Currently developing a modified launcher to be compatible with the ModTheGalaxy development VM server.
I'm doing this independently for practice and fun.  If you are interested in helping let me know.  I am
a seasoned IT professional and really really rusty at development.  Currently disabled.
